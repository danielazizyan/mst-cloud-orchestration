# Minimum Spanning Tree Experiments with Cloud Native Orchestration

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for streamlining Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms in a cloud-native environment. The project focuses on optimizing deployment, scalability, and orchestration using Packer, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine before proceeding with the implementation:

- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (for Kubernetes)
- [eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html) (for EKS cluster setup)
